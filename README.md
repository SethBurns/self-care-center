### Context:
[//]: <> I had 2 evenings to work on this project. I'm in MOD 1 of Turing, this is the first app I've created where the HTML, CSS, and Javascript are all done by me. (Except a couple lines that already linked the CSS and Java to the HTML.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The learning goals were to be able to replicate a picture of a webpage and add the functionality desired by the 'client'. Learning how to manipulate HTML elements with CSS and adding the appropriate divs to the HTML were key in replicating the look that the 'client' provided.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> Learning flexbox was a win for me. I was able to self teach and finish the project before our lesson on Thursday. The lesson helped clarify and clean up some of what I had learned in my head. Successfully writing my javascript through pseudocode and careful planning was also a win for me. Things really fell into place for me on this project and I was able to complete it quickly.
